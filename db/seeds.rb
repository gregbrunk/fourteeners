Elbert was named for Samuel Hitt Elbert, who arrived in the Colorado Territory in 1862 as secretary to Governor John Evans (for whom Mt. Evans is named, and whose daughter, Josephine, Elbert later married). President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Samuel Elbert territorial governor of Colorado in 1873. Although Elbert was territorial governor for less than a year, he later served 20 years on the Colorado State Supreme Court. Elbert's name appeared on maps of the mountain before 1873.",

After completing its first recorded ascent to install a bronze summit register in 1916, Roger Toll (1883-1936), a prominent pioneering member of the Colorado Mountain Club, named this Collegiate Peak 14er Mt. Columbia in honor of the famous Ivy League university, from which he graduated in 1906 with a degree in civil engineering, and in keeping with the tradition of naming the Collegiate Peak 14ers after famous universities.",

Ellingwood was born in Iowa in 1888, attended high school in Colorado Springs, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to England's Oxford University, where he learned the skills of technical rock climbing. <br />He was a professor of political science at Colorado College (Colorado Springs), at Lake Forest College (Lake Forest, IL), and Northwestern University (Evanston, IL). He was an Assistant Dean at Northwestern University until his death in 1934. Ellingwood made numerous first ascents in Colorado, including those of Kit Carson Peak, Crestone Needle, and Crestone Peak, the last of Colorado's 14ers to be climbed (in July 1916). He also made the first ascent of Lizard Head, Middle Teton, and South Teton, as well as the third ascent of the Grand Teton. In addition, he made the first ascent of Ellingwood Arete on the northeast face of Crestone Needle. Ellingwood Ridge, the spectacular Northwest Ridge of La Plata Peak, was also named for Albert Ellingwood, who made its first ascent solo in 1921.",

    name: "Uncompahgre Peak",
    range: "San Juan Mountains",
    elevation: "14309",
    rank: 6,
    description: "Historians disagree about the exact origin of the mountain's name. The earliest recorded sighting of the mountain was by Lieutenant E.G. Beckwith, official recorder for the Gunnison Expedition of 1853, who called it Uncompahgre. Some scholars contend that Uncompahgre is a derivation from the ancient Ute words that mean hot (unca) water (pah) spring (gre). Others argue that the mountain's name is a distortion of the Ute word ancapogari, which means red lake. Both of these possible word-origins seem to refer to the natural reddish hot springs, located near the present-day town of Ouray (about 12 miles WSW of the mountain), that were a favorite campground of the Utes. <br />Another early recorded sighting of Uncompahgre was by from Engineer Pass (about 9Â½ miles SW of the mountain) by E.H. Rufner, during a reconnaissance of the Ute Indian territory in 1873. Apparently unaware of Beckwith's earlier sighting, Rufner named the peak Mt. Chavenet, in honor of a professor of astronomy at Washington University in St. Louis. Contributing to the host of names by which the peak was known, early miners in the area referred to it as the Leaning Tower or Capitol Mountain.",

    name: "Crestone Peak",

    elevation: "14294",
    rank: 7,
    description: "Some time before 1853, trappers and traders entered the San Luis Valley (west of the Crestones) and saw some resemblance between the Crestone Group (The Needle, the Peak, and Kit Carson) and the Three Tetons of Wyoming, which were the best known mountains of the west. Thus, the Crestone Group is called the Trois Tetons on the Wheeler Survey's maps of 1877 and 1879. Crestone Peak and Needle were also once known as the Crestone Needles and as the Spanish Crags. According to Spanish lexicons, the name Crestone has many meanings, including a large crest, cock's comb, crest of helmet, or outcropping of ore (the suffix -on means large)...as seen from the south, the present Crestone Peak is remarkably like a cock's comb; most people are sure of the resemblance - (Hart, 1977, p. 25). <br /> The last Colorado 14er to be climbed (by Albert Ellingwood and Eleanor Davis on July 24, 1916), Crestone Needle was first named the South East Spannish (sic) Crag by the U.S. Land Office Survey of 1883. However, locals referred to the mountain as simply one of the Needles. In 1921, the Colorado Mountain Club named the mountain Crestone Needle, and in 1923, the CMC officially accepted this name for its list of Colorado highpoints.",
