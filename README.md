# fourteeners
fourteeners is a prototype app to help climbers track all 14'ers in Colorado, and which they have conquered.

The goal of this project was to excercise building a complete RESTful API on Ruby/Sinatra, using Active Record to interact with a PostgreSQL database. I also wanted to test my skills in mobile optimization and building a front-end according to fairly polished designs.

Links:
- Link to live game site (heroku) - https://fourteeners-app.herokuapp.com/
- Wireframes - see "Wireframes" folder in the project repo (or in Trello).
- Trello Project Board - https://trello.com/b/zPiE11Wx/fourteeners

Technologies Used:
- jQuery/AJAX
- Bootstrap CSS and JS
- Ruby & Sinatra
- PostgreSQL & ActiveRecord
- SweetAlerts
- Heroku (hosting)

What's next?
- Finish seeding database with mountain data
- Users will be able to add a "summit" to a particular mountain with a photo, their name, and a date. 
- User authentication, profile management and mountain tracking.
- Admin/public api access control.

Outstanding Issues:
- Database is unfinished
- Mobile optimization is less than ideal, particularly in the mountain list (index).

This app was developed as Project #2 for my General Assembly Denver - WDI Immersive course.
