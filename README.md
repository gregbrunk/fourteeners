The goal of this project was to build a complete RESTful API on Ruby/Sinatra, using Active Record to interact with a PostgreSQL database. I also wanted to test my skills in mobile optimization and building a front-end as close to original design concepts as possible.

*Note: the inspiration for this project was a mobile concept pulled together by Alex Eiman on Dribbble. Alex's work is brilliant! The original concept can be found here: https://dribbble.com/shots/2520861-Fourteeners-App-Cards.*

**Technologies Used:**
- Ruby & Sinatra
- jQuery/AJAX
- Bootstrap CSS and JS
- PostgreSQL & ActiveRecord
- SweetAlerts
- Heroku (hosting)

**What's next?:**
- Finish seeding database with mountain data
- Users will be able to add a "summit" to a particular mountain with a photo, their name, and a date. 
- User authentication, profile management and mountain tracking.
- Admin/public api access control.

**Outstanding Issues:**
- Database is unfinished
- Mobile optimization is less than ideal, particularly in the mountain list (index).
